# Vite App

A Vite-powered application template.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. You can check if you have it installed by running:

```bash
node -v
```

You should see a version number if it is installed. Vite requires Node.js version 12.0 or higher.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your Vite app:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd <project-name>
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Alternatively, if you're using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   You can start the Vite development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or with Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
